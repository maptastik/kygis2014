## Introduction ##
[insert whatever I wrote before]

## What is a story map, broadly? ##

- What do the platforms suggest?
	- OdysseyJS
	- StoryMapJS
	- MapStory
	- ESRI
		- AGOL
		- Content
		- Features
- define "story"
- define "map"
- define "story + map"
	- Is this what we're seeing in what is being advertised as story maps?
		- No
		- But why aren't we? Sine ESRI appears to be the the most prominent driver and marketer of story maps, let's look closer at how they talk about story maps

## How does ESRI present story maps? ##
- Their answer to "What is a story map?"
	> Story maps use geography as a means of organizing and presenting information. They tell the story of a place, event, issue, trend, or pattern in a geographic context. They combine interactive maps with other rich content—text, photos, video, and audio—within user experiences that are basic and intuitive.
- Breaking down the parts of the definition
	- Geography is the organizing structure
		- This is what most maps are
	- It puts information in a geographic context
		- This addresses setting/where.
	- It combines maps with other media for simple user-experience
		- It allows for other media forms that add context that might not necessarily be spatial

## Why is ESRI's conception of story maps problematic ##
- It can result in a story, but because it is centered on the map rather than story, it doesn't necessarily
- Their marketing actively encourages storyless story maps

## How can we rethink story maps to insure they tell a story ##
- Focus on story first!
- Recognize that maps don't tell stories, people do. Placing content in a geographic context only yields a story once someone can make the connections between that content
- Look to those who regularly practice storytelling
	- Artists
	- Choreographers (Brooke's interview)
	- Movies/TV
- Data Viz is currently having this discussion now and has a lot of good stuff for us to think about in terms of balancing story with exploration
